multioot - a Mastodon CLI client with multi-instance timeline merging
=====================================================================
NOTE: the console command for this is "toot", if you want to change that, change "'toot=toot.console:main'" at the end of setup.py to  "'COMMAND_NAME=toot.console:main'"

What do I mean by "multi-instance timeline merging"?
well, I and a few other people wished that Mastodon was more of a reddit-like thing where you could subscribe to an instance, like how you can subscribe to subreddits. I decided to make this functionality client-side, because it's fairly easy.
